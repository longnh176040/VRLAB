      </Suggestion3>
    </Speech1>
    <Speech2>
      <Suggestion1>
        How long does it take you to reach the office everyday?

      </Suggestion3>
    </Speech2>
    <Speech3>
      <Suggestion1>
        Wow, that’s quite a long journey. Do you drive a car?
      </Suggestion1>
      <Suggestion2>
        Wow, I thought you lived near the office. You go to work by car, right?
      </Suggestion2>
      <Suggestion3>
        Oh! It’s quite tough for you to reach the office everday when you live so far. You drive a car, right?
      </Suggestion3>
    </Speech3>
    <Speech4>
      <Suggestion1>
        You are right! But I get up a little late. That gives me no other option but to travel by scooter.
      </Suggestion1>
      <Suggestion2>
        Can’t agree more. I think public bus is the best choice.
      </Suggestion2>
      <Suggestion3>
        Right! But in my opinion, driving by car is more convenient.

        Mr.A, I want to talk to you for a while. Do you have time ?

      </Suggestion3>
    </Speech1>
    <Speech2>
      <Suggestion1>
        Frankly speaking, I’m not very pleased with my job now.
      </Suggestion1>
      <Suggestion2>
        To be honest, I’m not contented with my current job.
      </Suggestion2>
      <Suggestion3>
        Straight from the shoulder, I’m dissatisfied with my job.
      </Suggestion3>
    </Speech2>
    <Speech3>
      <Suggestion1>
        I have found that the colleagues of mine were not easy to work with, and what I do seems so boring.
      </Suggestion1>
      <Suggestion2>
        It is difficult for me to get on well with my fellows, and I’m not very interested in what I do also.
      </Suggestion2>
      <Suggestion3>
        Almost my colleagues are dead wood, and my work doesn’t offer much job satisfaction.
      </Suggestion3>
    </Speech3>
    <Speech4>
      <Suggestion1>
        Yes, so I want to work somewhere else. I mean a different sort of job.
      </Suggestion1>
      <Suggestion2>
        Yes, of course. Therefore, I desire to change my position to a different kind of job.
      </Suggestion2>
    </Speech4>
  </Scene14>
  <Scene15>
    <Speech1>
      <Suggestion1>
        Mr.A, Do you have a minute?
      </Suggestion1>
      <Suggestion2>
        Mr.	A, I want to talk to you for a minute.
      </Suggestion2>
    </Speech1>
    <Speech2>
      <Suggestion1>
        My dad is in hospital. I’d like to ask one-week off to take care of him.
      </Suggestion1>
    </Speech2>
    <Speech3>
      <Suggestion1>
        I don’t know. The doctor asked him to be in hospital and have more check-ups.
      </Suggestion1>
      <Suggestion2>
        I’m not sure, but he is asked to stay in hospital to have regular check-ups.
      </Suggestion2>
    </Speech3>
    <Speech4>
      <Suggestion1>
        I hope so. I’m impatient to go back.
      </Suggestion1>
      <Suggestion2>
        Hope so. I’ve got to go back.

      </Suggestion3>
    </Speech5>
  </Scene15>
  <Scene16>
    <Speech1>
      <Suggestion1>
        Actually it was really a challenge to me.
      </Suggestion1>
      <Suggestion2>
        Thank you for saying so. It is not really difficult as you think.
      </Suggestion2>
      <Suggestion3>
        You flatter me.
      </Suggestion3>
    </Speech1>
    <Speech2>
      <Suggestion1>
        If not having the support from you I couldn’t have got the achievement.
      </Suggestion1>
      <Suggestion2>
        Yeah, I spent a lot of time on this project.
      </Suggestion2>
      <Suggestion3>
        I’m just trying to finish my job.
      </Suggestion3>
    </Speech2>
    <Speech3>
      <Suggestion1>
        I would appriciate that.
      </Suggestion1>

      <Suggestion1>
        I think your prices are much too high.
      </Suggestion1>
      <Suggestion2>
        The prices are unaffordable.
      </Suggestion2>
      <Suggestion3>
        What? How can you come up with this price ?
      </Suggestion3>
    </Speech2>
    <Speech3>

      <Suggestion1>
        We need those items urgently. I thought if I met with you face-to-face, it would expedite the process.
      </Suggestion1>
      <Suggestion2>
        We really need those items for production. May I see you to expedite the process ?

      <Suggestion1>
        I’ve made a tough decision, Mr.A. Here is my resignation.
      </Suggestion1>
      <Suggestion2>
        I know it’s a little sudden, but here is my resignation.
      </Suggestion2>
      <Suggestion3>
        Mr.A, I decided to resign, and I want you to accept my request of resignation.
      </Suggestion3>
    </Speech2>
    <Speech3>
      <Suggestion1>
        I’ve been trying, but I don’t think I’m up to this job.
      </Suggestion1>
      <Suggestion2>
        After a while of working here, I realize that I’m not fit into this job.
      </Suggestion2>
    </Speech3>
    <Speech4>
      <Suggestion1>
        Yes, it is my decision after deep consideration.

      <Suggestion1>
        I’ve already been here for too long. I think it’s time to move on.
      </Suggestion1>
      <Suggestion2>
        I just want to try others kind of occupations.
      </Suggestion2>
      <Suggestion3>
        This work didn’t offer much job satisfaction. So I decided to leave.
      </Suggestion3>
    </Speech2>
    <Speech3>
      <Suggestion1>
        I will go to X Company.
      </Suggestion1>
      <Suggestion2>
        I haven’t decided yet.

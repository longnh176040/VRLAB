## VR UI Kit: Material Design System

**Installation:**

-   Download Oculus Integration from the Asset Store and import it into your project
    
-   Download and import this package
    
-   Open the SampleScene. That's it!
    

**How to use:**
SampleScene is a good place to start. It will show you the various VRUI prefabs that are available, along with a VRUIManager game object that control the color schemes.

To use the VRUI prefabs in your scene, first, add the VRUIManager game object, then add the VRUI prefabs that you want to use. It is as simple as that.

Offering a more effective way of learning English via Virtual Reality (VR) technology


## What is the problem ?
We conducted a survey of teaching and learning English in Vietnam and noticed a few problems which exist not only in Vietnam but also in other parts of the world.
* Communication is always the most important skill of any language. However, teaching English in traditional schools only focuses on grammar, not on communication. This makes it difficult for students to apply their English knowledge in daily life.
* The cost of learning communication is very high, especially in English centers, where there is an advantage in teaching communication due to the large number of native speakers.
* Learning English communication through the app requires learners to have high self-discipline. In addition, it does not provide users with direct interaction with the context they are participating in.
* English learners are often afraid to use English in communication because they are afraid of being wrong or not being able to express what they want to say.

## How can technology help?
Based on the above reality, our team offers a solution that is to learn English communication through Virtual Reality (VR) technology. 
* Virtual reality technology provides learners with an intuitive context. In our project, learners will play the role of a character and participate in a designed storyline, their task is to complete the conversation in that story.
* Virtual reality technology also allows users to interact directly with objects in that world. In this project, every time a user interacts with an object, the name of the item is displayed along with its meaning. As a result, learners can easily associate images and semantics, learning vocabulary from them also becomes easier.
* Learning English using virtual reality technology is no longer a new thing. The highlight of this project is that we will go deeper into each specific field, such as office, mechanics, space... Each field will have some specialized vocabulary. This can cater to different needs of learners, especially when they want to learn about a particular area.
* Learning English in a 360-degree world will help learners feel more excited than interacting with a phone screen
